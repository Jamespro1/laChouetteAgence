# SEO Optimization Case Study: La Chouette Agence

This repository serves as a practical case study for optimizing an existing website for search engines (SEO).

## Project Overview

The goal was to improve the search engine ranking of "La Chouette Agence," a web design agency based in Lyon, France, by optimizing its existing website.

## Initial Codebase

The original website code, which required optimization, can be found in the initial commits of this repository. This version contained several issues hindering its SEO performance, including poorly structured HTML, missing alt tags, non-optimized images, and lack of semantic markup.

## Optimization Process & Reports

An initial SEO audit was conducted to identify key areas for improvement. Based on this audit, a series of optimizations were implemented.

The detailed findings of the initial audit and the subsequent optimization report are available in the `audit-seo-optimization-reports` folder:

*   **Initial SEO Audit:** Contains the analysis of the original website's SEO weaknesses.
*   **Optimization Report:** Documents the specific changes made to improve SEO performance. Available in both PDF and Markdown formats.

You can view the [Optimization Report here](./audit-seo-optimization-reports/optimization-report.md).

This case study demonstrates the practical application of on-page SEO techniques to enhance website visibility and search engine ranking.
